Welcome to MXNET MPICH Cluster!

Try this to see all host names in the cluster:
$ mpirun hostname

You don't need to provide host file to MPI because the default host file
of connected nodes in the cluster is automatically updated at /etc/opt/hosts

To obtain hostfile manually and provide to MPI by yourself:
$ get_hosts > hosts
$ mpirun -f hosts hostname
